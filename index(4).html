  <h1>Scary Stories</h1>
  
  <h2>”The Car That Ate Your Brain” by Andrew J. Hawkins</h2>
    <p>
    The translucent egg-shaped shuttle glided silently to the curb. 
    A bright light flashed my face, causing my vision to blur and a second later a woman’s gentle voice said, <span>“Welcome aboard, Andrew.”</span>
    The interior of the shuttle was Airbnb-sparse but inviting. 
    I sat on the gray leather bench and pulled out my phone. 
    There were several bottles of water next to a box of Kind bars and some succulents. 
    Smooth jazz oozed from hidden speakers.
    But the shuttle stayed stationary, and my phone was dead, a black rectangular void; the Company’s shuttles were essentially rolling Faraday cages: no wireless service allowed. 
    They had to be for what came next.
    The mood lighting suddenly shifted to a spastic, woozy display of neon pinks, blues, and greens as an advertisement for the latest energy drink consumed the shuttle’s interior. 
    All trips via the Company’s shuttles this month were subsidized by the energy drink. 
    That’s why they were so cheap. Next month would be underwritten by a dandruff shampoo. The month after that, the US Army.
    The ad was way louder than it needed to be. 
    The flashing, staccato lights were starting to make my eyes burn. I remember a time when you could skip after five seconds. 
    I remember being able to opt out.
    Eventually, the shuttle began to drive. It knew where I was going because it had all my metadata, including my search history. 
    Over the course of the trip, I was bombarded with targeted ad after targeted ad. 
    The shuttle’s AR windshield became a tapestry of wish-fulfillment: images of my face on a more sculpted body in an ad for a barre class, an image of me with a beautiful woman purring about a dating app. 
    Did I know there was available real estate in this neighborhood that was within my price range? My phone was still bricked. 
    I tried shutting my eyes, but infrared sensors picked up on that and the shuttle slowed to a crawl. These ads were mandatory viewing.
    Opening my eyes again, I was startled by the sudden appearance of a hologram of my mother on the armrest. 
   <span> “Don’t forget to buy life insurance, darling"</span>, she wailed, her face frozen in anguish. 
    The shuttle was using a funeral home photo plucked from my cloud as a reference for the hologram; I could tell because she’d never in her life worn that candy-apple-pink blush the mortician applied.
    The algorithm was primed to look for an old photo, but of course, the funeral home photo counted as old, all these years later. I flinched as her tiny, translucent hand reached for mine. Was I dreaming, or was it getting colder? <span> “Fifteen minutes saves you 15 percent,”</span> she moaned.
    My dead mother stayed with me until the end of the ride, imploring me to buy life insurance, Yankee candles, and a new air freshener called <span>“Avocado Breeze.” </span> Finally, the ride concluded, and she morphed back to her reference photo before vanishing. I felt cold and wanted to step into the sun, but the shuttle door remained closed and locked, trapping me inside. Three more ads in exchange for my freedom.
    The techno music began to peak, building and building and building. They were cramming in as many images as possible. It became an unreadable blur, but the tempo kept ascending. I felt dizzy, nauseous, near death. In despair, I waited for the beat to drop. Finally, I implored it to, screaming at the flashing screens, begging for relief. But it never came.

  <h2>”The Moderators” by Adi Robertson</h2>
    <p>
    One night, a woman checked her DMs and found a message listing her home address and threatening to murder her.
    The frightened woman reported the threat and went to sleep. When she woke up, she expected the platform to say the message was protected free speech, as usual. But miraculously... the user had been suspended.
    The internet had changed. Tech companies began reporting threats to police. They shut down neo-Nazi forums. They banned genocide-fomenting propaganda bots, causing fascist political parties to dissolve. The web started to feel almost safe.
    A few weeks later, the woman picked up her phone to talk to a friend. But the chat app had no on-screen keyboard — just a list of bland pre-canned auto-replies. She tapped a selection, only to see a link appear below it, recommending a product she’d recently bought.
    The woman swore in frustration and tried again… but her phone had locked up. <span>“It sounds like you’re angry,”</span> blinked an error message. <span>“You can log back on when you’ve calmed down!” </span> It offered to let her online if she bought a health monitoring bracelet and signed up for SoulCycle.
    Desperate, the woman grabbed a pen and paper, intending to write a letter. But as she signed her name, she realized…
    The internet companies were moderating the postal service, too.

    <h2>“Bad Connection” by Casey Newton</h2>
       <p>
        Dana woke up in the hospital and reached for her phone.
        Her face had been bruised by the explosion, and she was worried that her phone wouldn’t recognize her. 
        But after an extra half-second, her phone unlocked, and she navigated to the camera roll.
        Dana exhaled in relief. The video she had taken before the explosion was still there. 
        In it, you could clearly see the soldiers carrying an explosive device onto the stage before the rally. 
        She had only noticed them because, as a volunteer working security, she had seen them slip in the back. 
          They had convinced her that the device was for surveillance, to protect everyone there to see the candidate speak. 
        But it seemed suspicious, and so she shot a short, furtive video of them walking with it backstage.
        A few minutes later, her world went black.
      From her phone, she opened Facebook and went to post a video. 
      After the upload, a now-familiar message appeared on the screen: DETERMINING ACCURACY.
    The Fake News Act of 2024 had required social networks to prevent the spread of false information. Anyone who attempted to violate the act could be subject to fines or prison. 
    It was off to a rocky start — Facebook was using a new artificial intelligence tool to do most of the compliance, and the results could be unpredictable.
    But Dana knew what she saw.
    A moment later, a blinking red square appeared on the screen. <span>“It appears that you are trying to share false news,” </span> the message read. “This is in violation of Facebook’s terms of services and of federal law. 
    Your posting privileges have been temporarily suspended while we investigate.”
    Dana’s heart dropped. She searched for news of the bombing across social media using the hashtag that everyone seemed to be using. What she saw was unrecognizable.
Every video she saw showed a different person carrying a bomb into the rally. Some showed the candidate herself carrying it in, in terrifying detail. Others showed long-dead historical figures and pop stars sneaking into the facility, their arms laden with explosives. One showed a beautifully animated Mickey Mouse as the culprit.
Dana switched to Twitter, where the president had recently sent out a message. <span>“Incredible to see my opponents bombing themselves at their own rallies. Awful!”</span>
A small cry now from Dana. Even the bad deepfakes were better than anything she had seen before.
The phone started to glitch, then made a loud and unfamiliar noise. A message appeared on the screen: <span>“Dana Hassan, you are now a suspect in an open false news investigation. This phone is now evidence. Do not attempt to dispose of this phone in any way.”</span>
A law enforcement officer, the message said, was en route to her location.
